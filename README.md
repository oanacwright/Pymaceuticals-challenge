# Pymaceuticals-challenge
UTA-VIRT-DATA-PT-09-2024-U-LOLC Module 5 Challenge

Background
You've just joined Pymaceuticals, Inc., a new pharmaceutical company that specializes in anti-cancer medications. Recently, it began screening for potential treatments for squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a commonly occurring form of skin cancer.

As a senior data analyst at the company, you've been given access to the complete data from their most recent animal study. In this study, 249 mice who were identified with SCC tumors received treatment with a range of drug regimens. Over the course of 45 days, tumor development was observed and measured. The purpose of this study was to compare the performance of Pymaceuticalsâ€™ drug of interest, Capomulin, against the other treatment regimens.

The executive team has tasked you with generating all of the tables and figures needed for the technical report of the clinical study. They have also asked you for a top-level summary of the study results.

The following tasks were accomplished:
- data was prepared and cleaned
- summary statistics for each drug regimen was generated (mean, median, variance, std, sem of tumor volume)
- bar charts, using both Pandas and Matplotlib, of Mouse ID vs Timepoints were generated
- pie charts, using both Pandas and Matplotlib, showing the distribution of unique females vs males were generated
- quarantiles, outliers and box plot were calculated for each mouse across four of the most promising treatment regimens
- line plot of single mouse treated with Capomulin (mouse weight vs av tumor volumne) was generated
- scatter plot of mouse weight vs average observed tumor for the entire Capomulin treatment was generated
- correlation coeffiecnet and linear regression model of mouse weight and average observed tumor volume for entire Capomulin treatment regimen with linear regression plotted.
